when men shall say there is a casting down
i will say there is a lifting up
i can never be disadvantaged                         
no good thing can be withheld from me
my name is mentioned for good
glorious things are spoken of me
I am a child of God.
Jesus loves me and that is enough
i am the best SRE in research square
i receive the grace to accomplish much
Thank you lord for blessing me with the gift of life.
